PourLogic Privacy Policy
Effective Date: February 26, 2026

PourLogic ("we," "us," or "our") operates the PourLogic mobile app (the "App"), an inventory management tool designed for bars and hospitality professionals. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle data. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices across iOS and tvOS platforms, including any third-party services. By using the App, you consent to these practices.

Information We Collect
We collect minimal data necessary for core functionality and improvement:

User-Provided Data: Bar inventory details (e.g., bottle counts, vendors, purchase history), account info (email, name), and usage preferences you enter manually.

Automatically Collected Data: Device info (model, OS version), app usage analytics (e.g., feature interactions, crash reports), and non-unique identifiers for debugging.

No Sensitive Data: We do not collect payment details, precise location, health data, or contacts. No user content is scanned for ads.

Data is collected only with your explicit input or standard device APIs—no camera/microphone access beyond optional barcode scanning.

How We Use Data
App Functionality: Process inventory logs, generate reports, and sync across your devices.

Analytics & Improvement: Aggregate anonymized usage stats to refine features (e.g., via Firebase Analytics or Apple’s App Analytics—no personal linking).

Support & Communication: Respond to support requests using your provided email.

Legal Compliance: Detect fraud or meet regulatory needs (rare for B2B inventory tools).

We do not sell data. No data links to your identity across apps/websites/devices.

Third-Party Partners
Analytics: Google Firebase (anonymized events only) or Apple frameworks—see their policies for details.

Cloud Sync (if implemented): Secure iCloud or Firebase storage with end-to-end encryption.

No ad networks, trackers, or IDFA usage—App Tracking Transparency prompt not required.

Data Sharing
No Sharing: Data stays on-device or your private account. No sales, marketing, or third-party access except:

Service providers (e.g., cloud hosts) under strict contracts.

Legal requirements (e.g., subpoenas).

International transfers use Standard Contractual Clauses if needed.

Your Choices & Controls
Delete data anytime via app settings or account deletion.

Opt out of analytics in device settings (iOS: Privacy > Analytics).

Optional privacy choices URL: pourlogic.com/privacy-choices (for future opt-outs).

Security
Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest. Regular audits, but no system is 100% secure—report issues to support@pourlogic.com.

Children’s Privacy
Not intended for under 13; no COPPA compliance needed.

Changes to This Policy
We’ll notify via app/email for material changes. Continued use implies acceptance.
